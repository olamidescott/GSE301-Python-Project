# Student Academic Performance Analysis System

This project is a Python-based console application designed to analyze and manage student academic records. It demonstrates core Python concepts such as data structures, control flow, error handling, pattern matching, and logical operations.

## Features
- Stores academic data for multiple students
- Converts scores to grades using IF–ELIF–ELSE
- Uses MATCH–CASE for feedback and menu control
- Validates user input with TRY–EXCEPT
- Performs list slicing and set operations
- Determines graduation eligibility
- Identifies top-performing students
- Interactive console menu system

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Variables and data types
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Type casting and validation
- Conditional logic
- MATCH–CASE (Python 3.10+)
- Error handling
- Logical operators
- Clean and readable code structure

## How to Run
```bash
python student_analysis.py
